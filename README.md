# COMSC-330-Project 
In this project, we’re going to create a system to calculate the GPA for a section of classes in order to document and group similar ranged data into a cohesive and all-inclusive format for the convenience of the user. Once all of the data is compiled, we’ll also find whether the GPA is statistically different from the group GPA, and also display this information.
